=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $cmd = App::Cmd->new(\%arg);

This method returns a new App::Cmd object.  During initialization, command
plugins will be loaded.

Valid arguments are:

  no_commands_plugin - if true, the command list plugin is not added

  no_help_plugin     - if true, the help plugin is not added

  no_version_plugin  - if true, the version plugin is not added

  show_version_cmd -   if true, the version command will be shown in the
                       command list

  plugin_search_path - The path to search for commands in. Defaults to
                       results of plugin_search_path method

If C<no_commands_plugin> is not given, L<App::Cmd::Command::commands> will be
required, and it will be registered to handle all of its command names not
handled by other plugins.

If C<no_help_plugin> is not given, L<App::Cmd::Command::help> will be required,
and it will be registered to handle all of its command names not handled by
other plugins. B<Note:> "help" is the default command, so if you do not load
the default help plugin, you should provide your own or override the
C<default_command> method.

If C<no_version_plugin> is not given, L<App::Cmd::Command::version> will be
required to show the application's version with command C<--version>. By
default, the version command is not included in the command list. Pass
C<show_version_cmd> to include the version command in the list.

=head2 run

  $cmd->run;

This method runs the application.  If called the class, it will instantiate a
new App::Cmd object to run.

It determines the requested command (generally by consuming the first
command-line argument), finds the plugin to handle that command, parses the
remaining arguments according to that plugin's rules, and runs the plugin.

It passes the contents of the global argument array (C<@ARGV>) to
L</C<prepare_command>>, but C<@ARGV> is not altered by running an App::Cmd.

=head2 prepare_args

Normally App::Cmd uses C<@ARGV> for its commandline arguments. You can override
this method to change that behavior for testing or otherwise.

=head2 default_args

If C<L</prepare_args>> is not changed and there are no arguments in C<@ARGV>,
this method is called and should return an arrayref to be used as the arguments
to the program.  By default, it returns an empty arrayref.

=head2 abstract 

   sub abstract { "command description" }

Defines the command abstract:Â a short description that will be printed in the
main command options list.

=head2 description

   sub description { "Long description" }

Defines a longer command description that will be shown when the user asks for
help on a specific command.

=head2 arg0

=head2 full_arg0

  my $program_name = $app->arg0;

  my $full_program_name = $app->full_arg0;

These methods return the name of the program invoked to run this application.
This is determined by inspecting C<$0> when the App::Cmd object is
instantiated, so it's probably correct, but doing weird things with App::Cmd
could lead to weird values from these methods.

If the program was run like this:

  knight!rjbs$ ~/bin/rpg dice 3d6

Then the methods return:

  arg0      - rpg
  full_arg0 - /Users/rjbs/bin/rpg

These values are captured when the App::Cmd object is created, so it is safe to
assign to C<$0> later.

=head2 prepare_command

  my ($cmd, $opt, @args) = $app->prepare_command(@ARGV);

This method will load the plugin for the requested command, use its options to
parse the command line arguments, and eventually return everything necessary to
actually execute the command.

=head2 default_command

This method returns the name of the command to run if none is given on the
command line.  The default default is "help"

=head2 execute_command

  $app->execute_command($cmd, \%opt, @args);

This method will invoke C<validate_args> and then C<run> on C<$cmd>.

=head2 plugin_search_path

This method returns the plugin_search_path as set.  The default implementation,
if called on "YourApp::Cmd" will return "YourApp::Cmd::Command"

This is a method because it's fun to override it with, for example:

  use constant plugin_search_path => __PACKAGE__;

=head2 allow_any_unambiguous_abbrev

If this method returns true (which, by default, it does I<not>), then any
unambiguous abbreviation for a registered command name will be allowed as a
means to use that command.  For example, given the following commands:

  reticulate
  reload
  rasterize

Then the user could use C<ret> for C<reticulate> or C<ra> for C<rasterize> and
so on.

=head2 global_options

  if ($cmd->app->global_options->{verbose}) { ... }

This method returns the running application's global options as a hashref.  If
there are no options specified, an empty hashref is returned.

=head2 set_global_options

  $app->set_global_options(\%opt);

This method sets the global options.

=head2 command_names

  my @names = $cmd->command_names;

This returns the commands names which the App::Cmd object will handle.

=head2 command_groups

  my @groups = $cmd->commands_groups;

This method can be implemented to return a grouped list of command names with
optional headers. Each group is given as arrayref and each header as string.
If an empty list is returned, the commands plugin will show two groups without
headers: the first group is for the "help" and "commands" commands, and all
other commands are in the second group.

=head2 command_plugins

  my @plugins = $cmd->command_plugins;

This method returns the package names of the plugins that implement the
App::Cmd object's commands.

=head2 plugin_for

  my $plugin = $cmd->plugin_for($command);

This method returns the plugin (module) for the given command.  If no plugin
implements the command, it returns false.

=head2 get_command

  my ($command_name, $opt, @args) = $app->get_command(@args);

Process arguments and into a command name and (optional) global options.

=head2 usage

  print $self->app->usage->text;

Returns the usage object for the global options.

=head2 usage_desc

The top level usage line. Looks something like

  "yourapp <command> [options]"

=head2 global_opt_spec

Returns a list with help command unless C<no_help_plugin> has been specified or
an empty list. Can be overridden for pre-dispatch option processing.  This is
useful for flags like --verbose.

=head2 usage_error

  $self->usage_error("Something's wrong!");

Used to die with nice usage output, during C<validate_args>.
