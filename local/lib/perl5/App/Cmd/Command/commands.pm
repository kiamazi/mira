=head1 VERSION

version 0.331

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will list all of the application commands available and their
abstracts.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 execute

This is the command's primary method and raison d'etre.  It prints the
application's usage text (if any) followed by a sorted listing of the
application's commands and their abstracts.

The commands are printed in sorted groups (created by C<sort_commands>); each
group is set off by blank lines.

=head2 C<sort_commands>

  my @sorted = $cmd->sort_commands(@unsorted);

This method orders the list of commands into groups which it returns as a list of
arrayrefs, and optional group header strings.

By default, the first group is for the "help" and "commands" commands, and all
other commands are in the second group.

This method can be overridden by implementing the C<commands_groups> method in
your application base clase.
