#pod   use App::Cmd::Tester::CaptureExternal;
#pod
#pod   use YourApp;
#pod
#pod   my $result = test_app(YourApp => [ qw(command --opt value) ]);

#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod L<App::Cmd::Tester> provides a useful scaffold for testing applications, but it
#pod is unable to capture output generated from any external subprograms that are
#pod invoked from the application.
#pod
#pod This subclass uses an alternate mechanism for capturing output
#pod (L<Capture::Tiny>) that does capture from external programs, with one
#pod major limitation.
#pod
#pod It is not possible to capture externally from both STDOUT and STDERR while
#pod also having appropriately interleaved combined output.  Therefore, the
#pod C<output> from this subclass simply concatenates the two.
#pod
#pod You can still use C<output> for testing if there is any output at all or for
#pod testing if something appeared in either output stream, but you can't rely on
#pod the ordering being correct between lines to STDOUT and lines to STDERR.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<App::Cmd::Tester> provides a useful scaffold for testing applications, but it
is unable to capture output generated from any external subprograms that are
invoked from the application.

This subclass uses an alternate mechanism for capturing output
(L<Capture::Tiny>) that does capture from external programs, with one
major limitation.

It is not possible to capture externally from both STDOUT and STDERR while
also having appropriately interleaved combined output.  Therefore, the
C<output> from this subclass simply concatenates the two.

You can still use C<output> for testing if there is any output at all or for
testing if something appeared in either output stream, but you can't rely on
the ordering being correct between lines to STDOUT and lines to STDERR.
